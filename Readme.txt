## üöÄ How to Deploy This Portfolio

This portfolio is a purely static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it very easy to deploy on various static hosting platforms.

Here are some popular options:

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Highly Recommended)

If this repository is your main portfolio repository, GitHub Pages is the easiest way to deploy it.

1.  **Ensure Repository Name:** If you want your site to be accessible via `https://<username>.github.io/`, make sure your repository name is `<username>.github.io`. Otherwise, the site will be accessible via `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.
2.  **Go to Repository Settings:** In your GitHub repository, click on the `Settings` tab.
3.  **Select Pages:** In the left sidebar, click `Pages`.
4.  **Choose Source:** Under the "Build and deployment" section, select `Deploy from a branch`.
5.  **Select Branch & Folder:** Choose `main` (or `master`) as your branch, and select `/ (root)` as the folder where your code is located.
6.  **Save:** Click `Save`.
7.  **Done!** GitHub Pages will build and deploy your site. It usually becomes available within a few minutes at the URL displayed on the Pages settings page.

### Option 2: Vercel

Vercel offers incredibly easy deployment, especially for front-end projects.

1.  **Visit Vercel:** Go to [https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/) and log in (you can use your GitHub account).
2.  **Import Project:** Click "New Project" and import your portfolio's GitHub repository.
3.  **Configure (Optional):** Vercel will automatically detect that this is a static HTML/CSS/JS project. You likely won't need to change any settings.
4.  **Deploy:** Click "Deploy". Vercel will automatically deploy your site and provide you with a live URL.

### Option 3: Netlify

Similar to Vercel, Netlify also provides quick deployment for static sites.

1.  **Visit Netlify:** Go to [https://www.netlify.com/](https://www.netlify.com/) and log in (you can use your GitHub account).
2.  **Import from Git:** Click "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project" -> "Deploy with GitHub".
3.  **Select Repository:** Choose your portfolio repository.
4.  **Build Settings:** Ensure "Base directory" is empty, "Build command" is empty, and "Publish directory" is `./`.
